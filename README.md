# Updated-Portfolio332

## Description 

In this project I have created a responsive design portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main focus was for the site to be responsive across all browser widths, and for it to be consistent with the design images provided by the GA Tech Bootcamp team.  Its files includes `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html`, and `style.css`. Each html file includes a navbar, responsive layout, responsive images, and a sticky footer.

The following are screenshots of website pages on a large browser width:

The following are screenshots of website pages on a medium browser width:
